The resistivity is compared with that of heavily Al-doped 4H-SiC grown by CVD. In the band conduction region, the hole mobility of the PVT-grown codoped samples is slightly lower than that of the CVD-grown sample at the same C Al. At C Al values of around 2 × 1020 cm−3, the temperature range in the variable-range-hopping conduction region for the PVT-grown codoped samples is much wider than that for the CVD-grown samples.",10.35848/1347-4065/acfb64,3,1,70,"{""grown by"": 70}",必须下载,强烈实验论文,chemical vapor transport,2025-09-15 15:58:29,2025-09-15 23:58:29.923065
