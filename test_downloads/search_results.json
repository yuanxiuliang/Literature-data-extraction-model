    "abstract": "  We consider the multiplicity of solutions for the $p(x)$-Laplacian problems\ninvolving the supercritical Sobolev growth via Ricceri's principle. By means of\nthe truncation combining with De Giorgi iteration, we can extend the result\nabout subcritical and critical growth to the supercritical growth and obtain at\nleast three solutions for the $p(x)$ Laplacian problem.\n",
