Recently, (K0.5Na0.5)NbO3-based single crystals have been grown by the seed-free solid-state crystal growth method, which can avoid these problems. In the present work, 0.98(K0.5Na0.5)NbO3–0.02(Bi0.5Na0.5)(Zr0.85Sn0.15)O3 single crystals were grown by the seed-free solid-state crystal growth method. Sintering aids of 0.15 mol% Li2CO3 and 0.15 mol% Bi2O3 were added to promote single crystal growth. Pellets were sintered at 1150 °C for 15–50 h. Single crystals started to appear from 20 h. The single crystals grown for 50 h were studied in detail. Single crystal microstructure was studied by scanning electron microscopy of the as-grown surface and cross-section of the sample and revealed porosity in the crystals. Electron probe microanalysis indicated a slight reduction in K and Na content of a single crystal as compared to the nominal composition. X-ray diffraction shows that the single crystals contain mixed orthorhombic and tetragonal phases at room temperature. Raman scattering and impedance spectroscopy at different temperatures observed rhombohedral–orthorhombic, orthorhombic–tetragonal and tetragonal–cubic phase transitions. Polarization–electric field (P–E) hysteresis loops show that the single crystal is a normal ferroelectric material with a remanent polarization (Pr) of 18.5 μC/cm2 and a coercive electrical field (Ec) of 10.7 kV/cm. A single crystal presents d33 = 362 pC/N as measured by a d33 meter.

It was found by the method of sequential selective etching that the island-shaped pits on the surface of InSb (111), are highly likely to be dislocation in nature, regardless of their size. In turn, the clusters of pits of «regular» shape, disappearing in the course of repeated etching, probably arise in the places where point defects come to the surface and are not associated with the formation of Lomer-Cottrell barriers or other dislocation clusters.

In this study, the mechanism of the effect of different temperature gradients on crystal growth is analyzed in depth using a combination of numerical simulation and experiment. The experimental results show that epitaxial growth of crystals occurs under positive temperature gradient conditions, while there is dissolution of seed crystals under negative temperature gradient conditions. The temperature, flow, and concentration data of the melted material during crystal growth were calculated using numerical simulation. The simulation findings reveal that the distribution of solution supersaturation varies according to temperature. High supersaturation at the bottom of the melt is favorable for crystal epitaxial growth on the surface of seed crystals under a positive temperature gradient. Meanwhile, low supersaturation at the top of the melt suppresses the hard polycrystalline layer here. Under negative temperature gradient conditions, low supersaturation at the bottom of the melt may lead to remelting of seed crystals, which is consistent with the experimental phenomenon. Furthermore, we propose an optimized heat source profile. This profile manages high supersaturation near seed crystals, aiding continuous growth. Finally, we have applied the curve in an applied way by proposing a multi-stage heating device, based on which the desired arbitrary temperature profile can be modulated.

The great challenges and opportunities in these fields are crystal growth technology, especially the high-quality and large-sized CsPbBr3 single crystals. In this work, the influences of growth parameters (temperature gradient, growth rate, cooling rate) and thermal stress by the vertical Bridgman method on the quality and performance of CsPbBr3 crystals are systematically studied. The final results show that 10°C cm-1 is the optimized temperature gradient and 0.5 mm h-1 is the suitable growth rate for CsPbBr3 crystal growth. The study also shows that a cooling rate of 10°C h-1 for the general temperature interval and 1°C h-1 for the phase transition temperature interval is helpful to balance crystal growth efficiency as well as crystal quality. Crystal cracks caused by thermal stress as well as crystal adhesion on the ampoule can be effectively solved by depositing a uniform carbon film on the ampoule in advance. The optical, electrical and detection performance are also investigated. The optical characterization in the wavelength region ranging from ultraviolet to infrared indicates the crystal has a low density of deep-level defects and good crystal quality.

 CoO2 (NCO), a type of sodium layered oxide, has attracted attention as a cathode material for sodium ion batteries (SIB). The P2-type NCO has a layered structure and is generally obtained as plate-like crystals. Crystal growth of high aspect ratio NCO would be desirable to improve output density. The flux method, which is a liquid-phase method using flux (molten salt) as a solvent, is a crystal growth method that can control the crystal plane. However, in the case of NCO crystal growth, the specific effects of the flux species have not been clarified. In addition, NCO has several phases (O3, P2, P'3, etc.), depending on the Na ratio. However, fluxes easily change the Na ratio in the reaction field. For this reason, experimental guidelines for crystal control cannot be established, and trial and error must be used. The experimental search space considered by the flux method is enormous, with at least 14,000 possible experimental search spaces (three levels of raw material species and heating temperatures, nine raw material Na:Co ratios, 18 flux species and even two-component mixtures are allowed), making an exhaustive search unrealistic. To overcome this issue, it would be necessary to develop a crystal phase diagram expressing the crystal polymorphism and aspect ratio. For this purpose, identification of fluxes effective for P2 phase formation and aspect ratio changes was carried out using a data-driven, wide-area experimental search.
 For the data-driven exploration, flux method experiments was conducted using the high-throughput flux method screening (HTFS) system, which was originally developed in our laboratory. In the experiments, the initial training data was collected using a grid search method, and applied to a Bayesian optimization system. In this time, regression model was constructed using the feature values extracted from X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns as the objective variables and the experimental conditions as the explanatory variables.
 About 50 experimental data were collected in a grid search using the HTFS. The formation of P2-type NCO crystals was confirmed in more than half of the samples. However, diffraction lines originating from the impurity Co3O4 were observed in some samples, confirming the strong dependence of the product on the experimental conditions. Data-driven experiments were then undertaken. A total of about 30 experiments were carried out, and in many cases P2-type crystal samples were obtained using Na-based fluxes. In addition, the aspect ratio depended on the flux species and barrel-type crystal morphology was grown in some Na-based fluxes. In this presentation, the mechanism of flux contribution to crystal growth is discussed in terms of solute-solvent interaction and surface energy.

Similarly, the seed crystal clamping growth method cannot avoid contact with external objects, leading to abnormal growth at the contact points and along the direction of the seed crystal holder, also resulting in certain defects.

The Czochralski (CZ) silicon single crystal growth process (CZ-SSCGP) is a phase transition process from solid to liquid that takes place in a high-temperature, enclosed furnace designed for single crystal growth. The direct measurement of crystal diameter and melt temperature using sensors can pose a challenge due to the physical limitations of the furnace. This study introduces a novel approach for modeling clustering based on data that integrate fuzzy C-means (FCM) and deep belief network (DBN) techniques. The proposed method aims to estimate the online crystal diameter and melt temperature. The objective of this approach is to efficiently and precisely derive the CZ-SSCGP model. In order to address the negative impact of nonequilibrium properties of data on the model, it is advisable to employ FCM to produce numerous subsets of data that exhibit comparable operating conditions. This is especially important because data change over time and are different in different working situations. In order to enhance the precision of the fitting process for crystal diameter and melt temperature, we amalgamate the output outcomes of DBN that have been constructed for each individual subset. It is imperative to address the nonlinear and time-varying features manifested by the engineering data. Industrial data are utilized for conducting diverse data experiments and comparative analyses.

We developed a CF3COOH/CF3CH2NH2 protocol to harvest single-crystal COFs within 1 to 2 days with crystal sizes of up to 150 microns. The generality was exemplified by the feasible growth of 16 high-quality single-crystal COFs that were structurally determined by laboratory single-crystal x-ray diffraction with resolutions of up to 0.79 angstroms.

Advanced deep level transient spectroscopy (DLTS) revealed that an electron trap with a short time constant at 0.2 eV below the conduction band minimum edge may contribute to the short minority carrier lifetime evaluated by time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL). The temperature dependence of steady-state photoluminescence suggested that the carrier recombination through the electron trap was nonradiative around room temperature, which supports the fact of the short carrier lifetime and lower current density in ZnSnP2 solar cells. Previously reported theoretical calculation suggests that such a trap comes from the antisite defect of Sn from the viewpoint of the thermodynamic transition level. We, thus, prepared ZnSnP2 crystals by the solution growth method under conditions with a higher chemical potential of Zn, and we achieved the enhancement of the carrier lifetime compared to that under other growth conditions. In this case, the evaluation of the liquidus temperature and chemical potentials by a thermodynamic model indicated that the formation of Sn antisite was effectively suppressed by a lower precipitation temperature in addition to the effect of chemical potentials.

Transition metal molybdenum (Mo) exhibits outstanding properties in light trapping and electromagnetic field confining, making it potentially valuable in 1.55 μm plasmonic waveguide applications. However, the reliable fabrication of high-quality Mo plasmonic waveguides is a significant challenge. A real-space micro-imaging study of the surface plasmon on Mo structures is still absent. In this study, we successfully prepared a single-crystalline Mo microrod waveguide structure and fabricated subwavelength gratings on it. The diffraction gratings were designed, optimized, and etched to excite the surface plasmon polariton behaviour of Mo for the first time. The grating-optimized Mo microrod single-crystal reveals highly efficient waveguide performance around near-infrared spectroscopy, exhibiting a long propagation length of 32 μm and a low transmission loss of 0.067 dB μm−1. The results provide an alternative to advanced materials research and optical device applications of plasmonic waveguide systems.",10.1515/nanoph-2023-0480,5,1,70,"{""crystal preparation"": 70}",必须下载,强烈实验论文,crystal preparation,2025-09-15 16:28:18,2025-09-16 00:28:18.830641

Potassium Titanium Oxygen Phosphate (KTiOPO4,KTP) is internationally recognized as a material with excellent comprehensive optoelectronic performance. After periodic polarization, KTiOPO4(PPKTP) can produce laser and entangled photon outputs of any wavelength within the crystal transmittance range using quasi-phase matching (QPM) technology, making it an ideal material for generating entangled photons for efficient frequency conversion and quantum communication. Its applications include laser manufacturing, quantum communication, electro-optical modulators, and optical waveguide devices. In this paper, the preparation of PPKTP crystal materials, the current status of development at home and abroad, and the applications in the quantum field are reviewed, and some challenges encountered in the preparation of the current hydrothermal PPKTP are also highlighted, and in future related research, the solution of these challenges is of great significance to improve the quality of the polarization reversal of the PPKTP and to promote the device's wider application.",10.1117/12.3046595,0,0,70,"{""crystal preparation"": 70}",必须下载,强烈实验论文,crystal preparation,2025-09-15 16:28:14,2025-09-16 00:28:14.820676
